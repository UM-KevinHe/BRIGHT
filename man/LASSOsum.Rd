\title{Fitting LASSOsum PRS (equivalent to BRIGHTs with eta=0)}
\usage{
LASSOsum(ss, ind, LDblocks, KG, N, ref, lab = "LASSOsum")
}
\arguments{
\item{ss}{a data frame of the summary statistics, including "GWAS" or "Corr" corresponding to the GWAS or correlation summary statistics, the input summary type must match with ind below.}

\item{ind}{a character scaler of the input summary type, it must be either "GWAS" or "Corr" corresponding to the GWAS or correlation summary statistics. It must match with the summary statistics in ss.}

\item{LDblocks}{a character scaler indicating the LD block structure to be used from Berisa et al for the population. It takes values from "EUR.hg19", "EUR.hg38", "AFR.hg19", "AFR.hg38", "EAS.hg19", "EAS.hg38", "AMR.hg19", "AMR.hg38", "SAS.hg19" or "SAS.hg38". The abbreviations before dot are populations (more detials can be found here: https://useast.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=532); The abbreviations after dot are the genetic build (more details can be found: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890951-Human-genome-reference-builds-GRCh38-or-hg38-b37-hg19). The genetic build must match with those provided in ref.}

\item{N}{a integer scaler indicating the sample sizes of the summary statistics input in ss.}

\item{ref}{a character scaler indicating the LD reference. It takes values as either a directory to user provided Plink 1 binary files (.bim, .bed, .fam) or the 1000 genome project reference provided by the package: "EUR.hg19", "EUR.hg38", "AFR.hg19", "AFR.hg38", "EAS.hg19", "EAS.hg38", "AMR.hg19", "AMR.hg38", "SAS.hg19" or "SAS.hg38". The abbreviations before dot are populations (more detials can be found here: https://useast.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=532); The abbreviations after dot are the genetic build (more details can be found: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890951-Human-genome-reference-builds-GRCh38-or-hg38-b37-hg19).}

\value{
A list of LASSOsum models corresponding to different hyperparameters. The BRcp are also output for hyperparameter fine tuning.

\description{
Fitting LASSOsum PRS. Quality control is performed first on the summary statistics (please see QC section). The hyperparameters are tuned through BRCp (equivalent to AIC).
